// Map Exploit Finder Config by D3M1G0D: http://steamcommunity.com/id/D3M1G0D/
// This config is designed to make finding map exploits/glitches easier by showing you where you can and cannot build or travel. The blue textures on the floor cover area where you can build, yet this does not show ALL of the buildable area. The blue wireframes show props that you collide with. If you collide with something that does not have a blue wireframe, it's because that object is part of the map itself. The purple walls are borders that you cannot pass/build through at all. You can use noclip to fly above and look for seams or weak points in these walls which you could possibly build through and get out of the map.
// This config is designed for use offline or on a local server. You cannot use it on a server with sv_cheats set to 0.
// Feel free to edit this config as needed!
sv_cheats 1                                                     // Needed for this config to work

r_dispbuildable 1                                               // Shows most, but not all buildable areas.
vcollide_wireframe 1                                    // Shows every prop you will collide with. Some things you collide with are not highlighted because they are part of the map itself.
